<time datetime="2021-06-06">06 Jun 2021</time>

<p>UniFOSS is an organization and discussion platform to consolidate all efforts toward building active FOSS communities in Indian colleges and universities. We made this because we want a thriving ecosystem for FOSS in universities, where the movement finds its roots. We want to enable the free flowing of knowledge, ideas and projects. Think of this place like a <strong>souk</strong> (also known as chowk or bazaar) which were the centers at which ideas from various different places got together and created prosperity.</p>
<p>We follow an invite-only system to control the growth of this community and prevent it from being passive and consumption-oriented. If you were invited here, this is because one of our members felt you were a producer and a contributor in some way or the other. Whether you are here to learn or to help others, we hope that you actively participate to make this work :)</p>
<p>You can find more information on the <a href="nonexistent">main website</a>.</p>
