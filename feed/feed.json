      "content_html": "<p>UniFOSS is an organization and discussion platform to consolidate all efforts toward building active FOSS communities in Indian colleges and universities. We made this because we want a thriving ecosystem for FOSS in universities, where the movement finds its roots. We want to enable the free flowing of knowledge, ideas and projects. Think of this place like a souk (also known as chowk or bazaar) which were the centers at which ideas from various different places got together and created prosperity.</p>\n<p>We follow an invite-only system to control the growth of this community and prevent it from being passive and consumption-oriented. If you were invited here, this is because one of our members felt you were a producer and a contributor in some way or the other. Whether you are here to learn or to help others, we hope that you actively participate to make this work :)</p>\n<h2 id=\"organization\">Organization <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#organization\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We follow a federated structure, with units called SIGs (Special Interest Groups) that are strongly autonomous. Our role here is just to give a common platform for the SIGs to communicate together. SIGs are responsible for their own branding and organization. Do what works best for your sub-community.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-constitutes-an-sig%3F\">What constitutes an SIG? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what-constitutes-an-sig%3F\">#</a></h3>\n<p>An SIG can be for pretty much any function, maybe it is for a FOSS project, organizing talks or helping people contribute to Open Source. Look at the rooms for the SIGs to get an idea. We are still in the process of figuring out what makes a good idea for an SIG, but our guiding principle is that an SIG should not overlap its functions with another.</p>\n",
